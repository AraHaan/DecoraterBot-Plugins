### DecoraterBot plugin cogs repo

All Plugins in this repo are installable and loadable to the bot.

### Notice

The voice plugin works perfectly or almost perfectly when the internet speed is 30 mb/s or higher.

Unless otherwise started. Most (if not all) Plugins are stable with exception to those that can break potentially with the current discord.py rewrite.

### Changing Plugins

Feel free to change any plugin if things like breaking changes to discord.py that your change fixes. You can also submit more plugins as well but keep on mind do not use any of the current plugin names or aliases as that can cause great conflict in the bot.
